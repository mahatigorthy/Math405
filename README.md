# MATH405 - Linear Algebra (University of Maryland)

Welcome to my repository for MATH405, modeled on *Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right*. This collection showcases my homework solutions and conceptual explorations from Fall 2025. I'd like to emphasize that I'm still learning, making mistakes, and learning from mistakes.

## 📚 About the Course

MATH405 is an advanced undergraduate course in linear algebra emphasizing conceptual understanding, proof-writing, and abstraction. The course follows Axler’s textbook, which prioritizes vector space theory, linear transformations, and avoids determinants until later chapters.
