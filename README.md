Abstract Linear Algebra
Math405 at the University of Maryland is an advanced abstract linear algebra course that builds upon an introductory linear algebra class by generalizing concepts like vector spaces, linear transformations, and eigenvalues to a more abstract setting.
I've gathered all my homeworks thusfar as I take this course, to document my learning and understanding.
